					<p>Bohol is one of the most beautiful places in South East Asia when it comes to scenic beauty. 
					   It has lots to offer you throughout your stay. The famous Chocolate Hills is the greatest

					<h1 class="Camiguin"> Loving Camiguin </h1>
					<p>Camiguin is the smallest province in Mindanao and the second smallest in the Philippines.
					   But donâ€™t judge it by its size. Often dubbed the Island Born of Fire, Camiguin harbors seven
					   volcanoes, including Mount Vulcan and Mount Hibok-hibok. Its landscape has been continuously 
					   shaped and reshaped by volcanic activities, giving this island paradise countless natural attractions.
